Pico controlled neopixel lights with l3gd20 gyroscope on a lazy Suzan written in python

Attempting to write a loop that runs during the entirety of the game
the loop with read the sensor data from the gyroscope and determine which pixel/light to light up
my_l3gd20.py neopixel.py are the libraries

everything else is WIP

L3GD20_SIMPLETEST reads the I2C gyro data and plots the readings

gyro_light.py is the master script where the gyro talks to the leds
